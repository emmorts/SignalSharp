# SignalSharp.

SignalSharp is a library designed for signal processing and time series analysis.

## Features

- **PELT Algorithm**: Efficiently detects multiple change points in time series data.
    - **L1 Cost Function**: Robust to outliers and non-Gaussian noise.
    - **L2 Cost Function**: Suitable for normally distributed data.
    - **RBF Cost Function**: Handles non-linear relationships between data points.
- **Savitzky-Golay Filter**: Smooths data to reduce noise while preserving the shape of the signal.
- **Kalman Filter**: Estimates the state of a linear dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements.
